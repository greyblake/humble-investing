## Books

### For Beginners

* [Stock Market Investing for Beginners: Essentials to Start Investing Successfully (Tycho Press)](https://amzn.to/2o4CBTH) - a small book filled with the most essential information about investing into the stock market. I read it at least 3 times. It's not a comprehensive investing guide, but definitely the best place to start.
* [Fundamental Analysis For Dummies (Matt Krantz)](https://amzn.to/2nwpXfU) - introduction into Fundamental Anlysis. It covers different financial ratios, explains basics how to read between the lines financial reports, perform discounted cash flow analysis and much more.
