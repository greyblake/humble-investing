## Books

### For Beginners

* [Stock Market Investing for Beginners: Essentials to Start Investing Successfully (Tycho Press)](https://amzn.to/2o4CBTH) - a small book filled with the most essential information about investing into the stock market. I read it at least 3 times. It's not a comprehensive investing guide, but definitely the best place to start.
* [Fundamental Analysis For Dummies (Matt Krantz)](https://amzn.to/2nwpXfU) - introduction into Fundamental Anlysis. It covers different financial ratios, explains basics how to read between the lines financial reports, perform discounted cash flow analysis and much more.

### Classics

* [The Intelligent Investor (Benjamin Graham)](https://amzn.to/2nrHZA6) - probably the best book ever written about investing. Once you feel more or less comfortable with the basics of the stock market you will enjoy reading this book. Every page is filled with the eternal wisdom. Warren Buffett says it's the best book on investing ever written. It's hard to disagree.
